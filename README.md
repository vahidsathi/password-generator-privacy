Privacy Policy Last updated: January 2026 This Privacy Policy describes how the Password Generator app (“the app”) handles user information. 1. Data Collection The app does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. All password generation and vault operations occur locally on your device. The app does not require user accounts and does not connect to any external servers for password processing. 2. Password & Vault Data All passwords stored in the vault are encrypted using Android’s secure keystore system. Sensitive actions (view, copy, add, delete, wipe) require device authentication. The app does not have access to your biometric data. All biometric processing is handled securely by the Android operating system. 3. Advertising The app displays advertisements using Google AdMob. AdMob may collect limited, non-personal information such as device identifiers, IP address, and ad interaction data for ad delivery and fraud prevention. This data is handled by Google in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. The app itself does not collect or store this data. 4. Internet Usage The app only uses internet access for loading advertisements and processing in-app purchases. Passwords and vault data are never transmitted off the device. 5. Data Deletion Users may delete all vault data at any time within the app. Uninstalling the app removes all local data permanently. 6. Children’s Privacy This app does not target children and does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 13. 7. Changes This policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page. 8. Contact If you have any questions about this policy, you may contact: Email: CipherWorks26@gmail.com
